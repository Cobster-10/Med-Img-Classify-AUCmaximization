This project attempts to maximize AUC score for machine learning models for image classification. 

To run familiarize yourself with instructions.txt. Be sure to use evaluate only and specify the model to use in the run command.

We mainly used the neural network architecture from LibAUC, a deep learning library specializing in performance metrics. 

We decided to use data augmentation, tune several hyper parameters such as learning rate, momentum, weight decay, epoch decay, margin, and sampling ratio, through grid search.

We experimented with different models such as DenseNet, ResNet, and Google AutoML
